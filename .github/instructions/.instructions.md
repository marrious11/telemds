# Agent Instructions

This file provides context and development history for the Telemedicine Platform (CSC404, Group 10).  
Use this as a reference for all future development and AI assistance.

## Key Points

- **Migrations:** All migrations are already applied; use the main backup SQL for setup.
- **Roles:** Role-based dashboards for patient, doctor, and superadmin.
- **Booking:** Patients book by describing symptoms; doctor assignment is automatic.
- **Entry Point:** `/public/index.php` is the main landing page.
- **Routing:** `.htaccess` routes all requests to `/public`.
- **Superadmin:** Has a dedicated login page, not shown on the main login.
- **Menus/Links:** All dashboard menus are role-aware and link to the correct pages.
- **Logout:** Session is destroyed and user is redirected to login with a message.
- **Documentation:** README is up-to-date with setup, usage, and troubleshooting.

## Setup & Running

- **Database:** Import `database/main.backup/telemeds_db_updated.sql`.
- **Web Root:** Point Apache/XAMPP to the project root; `.htaccess` handles routing.
- **No CLI Needed:** You do not need to start the PHP server from the command line in production.

## Troubleshooting

- **MySQL Connection:** If you see `No such file or directory`, change DB host from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` in `db.php`.
- **Session/User Issues:** Ensure users exist in the `users` table; session checks are enforced on booking and dashboards.

## Contribution

- Review the README for coding standards and structure.
- Archive old migrations; do not run them again.
- Reference this file and the README for project context before making changes.
